<p>We are going to take a closer look at how to emulate exceptions with <a href="https://github.com/mrexodia/dumpulator">Dumpulator</a> using a recent Guloader sample as an example.</p>
<p>Guloader SHA256 = <code>E3A8356689B97653261EA6B75CA911BC65F523025F15649E87B1AEF0071AE107</code> <a href="https://malshare.com/sample.php?action=detail&amp;hash=e3a8356689b97653261ea6b75ca911bc65f523025f15649e87b1aef0071ae107">malshare</a></p>

<a class="anchor" href="#Guloader-VEH" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guloader VEH<a class="anchor-link" href="#Guloader-VEH"> </a>
</h3>
<p>The sample we are analyzing uses a VEH trick to redirect program flow... basically they set their own VEH then use breakpoints <code>0xcc</code> in the code to trigger a small algorithm in the VEH. This aglorithm is used to caculate a new EIP based on the byte following the breakpoint.</p>

<pre><code>EIP = EIP + ([EIP + 1] ^ 0x8f)</code></pre>

<a class="anchor" href="#Obfuscated-Strings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obfuscated Strings<a class="anchor-link" href="#Obfuscated-Strings"> </a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to the VEH program flow obfuscation the sample also uses a two-stage string encryption algorithm. First, a function is used to fill a buffer with the encrypted string data using some unfolded constants and a bit of arithmatic. Then the buffer is passed to a string decryption algorithm. The first buffer fill function is often obfuscated using the VEH program flow redirection.</p>
