# Research Notes

This is our research notes repository, formerly known as "Lab-Notes". We use [Jupyter Notbooks](https://jupyter.org/) for all of our notes so we can directy include code. The raw notes can be found in this repository and our full blog is available online at [research.openanalysis.net](https://research.openanalysis.net).

## How To Add Notes

Great!  You have setup your repo.  Now its time to start writing content.  Some helpful links:

Note: you may want to remove example blog posts from the `_posts`,  `_notebooks` or `_word` folders (but leave them empty, don't delete these folders) if you don't want these blog posts to appear on your site.

Please use the [nbdev & blogging channel](https://forums.fast.ai/c/fastai-users/nbdev/48) in the fastai forums for any questions or feature requests.
