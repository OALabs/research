    "[Lumma](https://telegra.ph/LummaC2---universal-stealer-a-malware-for-professionals-07-27) has been around for a [while](https://www.esentire.com/blog/the-case-of-lummac2-v4-0) initially starting out with plaintext strings and simple to reverse code, but as they continue to evolve they added some [control flow flattening](https://outpost24.com/blog/lummac2-anti-sandbox-technique-trigonometry-human-detection/#h-control-flow-flattening) (CFF) and string encryption. With the latest build more obfuscation has been added which introduces opaque predicates to the CFF. We are going to attempt to use IDA scripting to remove this obfuscation.\n",

    "The opaque predicates are setup using a jump table with encrypted addresses, for direct jumps the address is simply moved into a register, decrypted, then jumped to. For conditional jumps the jump table is used like an index to locate the correct address, which is then decrypted and jumped to.\n",
