    "Let's take a look at the `.msi` and see what is in there, we can just use 7zip to unzip it. Inside the `.msi` we have a backdoored file `ffmpeg.dll`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1 `ffmpeg.dll`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Artifacts \n",
    "- `ffmpeg.dll` [7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896](https://malshare.com/sample.php?action=detail&hash=7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896)\n",

    "#### Functionality \n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses `CreateEventW` with the string `AVMonitorRefreshEvent` like a mutex to ensure it is only running once\n",
    "- Gets its process path (file location) to locate `d3dcompiler_47.dll` which it expects to be in the same directory \n",
    "- Scans `d3dcompiler_47.dll` for the magic hex bytes `0xFEEDFACE` \n",
    "- The magic bytes `0xFEEDFACE` occur twice in a row \n",
    "- All the file data following the magic bytes is decrypted with RC4 using the hard coded key `3jB(2bsG#@c7`\n",
    "- Once decrypted the data contains shellcode followed by an embedded PE file (Stage 2) which is loaded into memory and executed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signed DLL\n",
    "The `d3dcompiler_47.dll` DLL is signed by Microsoft. The `0xFEEDFACE` magic bytes suggest that the open source tool [SigFlip](https://github.com/med0x2e/SigFlip) was used to patch the authenticode signed PE file without breaking the signature.\n",

    "- Creates a file called `manifest` in the directory from which the process was launched \n",
    "- The `manifest` file is used to maintain a delay timer value for the malware\n",
    "- The delay is calculated by adding 7 days to a randomly generated value between 0 days and 20 days, 20 hours for a total potential delay of between 7 days, and 20 days 20 hours\n",
    "- When the malware executes this value is read from the `manifest` file and checked against the system time, if the time has not expired the malware will simply sleep\n",
    "- The `MachineGuid` key value is read from the registry key `Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Cryptography` then transformed into the following \"cookie\" value to be used in future C2 requests\n",
