    "## Creal Stealer\n",
    "Creal Stealer is an open source Python stealer shared on GitHub [Ayhuuu/Creal-Stealer)](https://github.com/Ayhuuu/Creal-Stealer). Though the stealer is open source the developer operates a Telegram channel which offers a \"Premium\" version of the stealer if you contact them.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Capabilites \n",
    "The stealer has a simple discord webhook upload config where the operator can specify a discord to upload the stolen information. According to the developer the stealer is undetected in VirusTotal but this is obviously [not the case](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/21a9b4859121afcf6690c2c15b795094986c0a20c36a356c3915f107ec41f67a) in practice. \n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "Though we are analyzing a creal sample a similar process can be followed for most python malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyInstaller\n",
    "The malware comes bundled in a [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) EXE which can be extracted using [https://github.com/pyinstxtractor/pyinstxtractor-ng]. Once extracted the bundled python interpreter, libraries, and compiled python files (`.pyc`) will be accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter DLL will have the Python version name listed in its name. Determining the version is important for the next step in the analysis process. We can also see the `creal.pyc` compiled Creal stealer module has been dumped.\n",

    "### Decompiling Python PYC\n",
    "Depending on the Python version determined in the previous step Karsten's excellent [CPython Bytecode Reference Chart](https://struppigel.github.io/WisdomForHedgehogs/Execution%20Environments/CPython%20Bytecode%20Reversing/) can be used to determine the correct decompiler tool to use. Personally I prefer [pycdc](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc) because it can be easily modified to handle any version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pycdc\n",
    "Currently pycdc cannot decompile python versions above 3.9 however it can disassemble them `pycdas`. This will return the disassembled python which is readable but not as easy to follow as the lifted python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/b50M8NJ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the sample is using Python 3.12 and when we attempt to decompile it with pycdc we get some errors and only partial code recovery.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unsupported opcode: BEFORE_WITH\n",
    "Unsupported opcode: LOAD_FAST_CHECK\n",
    "Unsupported opcode: BINARY_SLICE\n",
    "Unsupported opcode: JUMP_BACKWARD\n",
    "Unsupported opcode: JUMP_BACKWARD\n",
    "Unsupported opcode: JUMP_BACKWARD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Patched Pycdc\n",
    "We can modify pycdc to patch out the instruction case statement default return in `ASTRee.cpp` which causes the analysis to halt when an unknown instruction is encountered. By patching the return we force the analysis to continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/hHjty2W.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** this will produce incorrect decompiled code, but depending on which instructions are missing the code may end up very readable, and the disassembly can be used to fill in the gaps. In our case we can fully recover the discord hook url `https[:]//discord[.]com/api/webhooks/1221491784937373859/LiPQTxogVAKpzUO2MXT3CjiqF4qFWy_HT3DpUCrG4D8E0ZVZAGR_3uHvfQog2a0DFQyV'` and the majority of the code!\n",
