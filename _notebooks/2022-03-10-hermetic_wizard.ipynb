    "## WMI Spreader Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The WMI spreader is a stand-alone untility that is used to copy files to remote shares and execute them. The spreader is excuted via HermeticWizard using the following example command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `rundll32 <spreader path> #1 -s <path to HermeticWizard> â€“ i <target IP>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreader accepts the following command line arguments: `-i`,`-h`,`-s`,`-a`,`-c`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`s`** path to the file to copy\n",
    "- **`i`** remote host IP\n",
    "- **`h`** optional remote share path (*not confirmed)\n",
    "- **`a`** optional brute force share password (*not confirmed)\n",
    "- **`c`** optional brute force share username password list (*not confirmed)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Service Account \n",
    "The spreader checks to see if it has local admin priviledges. If it has local admin it attempts to impersonate the `Network Service` service account. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Stack Overflow reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/510170/the-difference-between-the-local-system-account-and-the-network-service-acco)\n",
    "\n",
    "> NetworkService account\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Limited service account that is meant to run standard privileged services. This account is > far more limited than Local System (or even Administrator) but still has the right to access the network as the machine (see caveat above).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService\n",
    "> - the account has no password (any password information you provide is ignored)\n",
    "> - HKCU represents the NetworkService user account\n",
    "> - has minimal privileges on the local computer\n",
    "> - presents the computer's credentials to remote servers\n",
    "> - **SID: S-1-5-20**\n",
    "> - has its own profile under the HKEY_USERS registry key (HKEY_USERSS-1-5-20)\n",
    "> - If trying to schedule a task using it, enter NETWORK SERVICE into the Select User or Group > dialog \n",
    "\n",
    "## Share file copy \n",
    "The spreader attempts to authenticate to the ADMIN&#36; remote share. If a password list is  supplied on the command line the share authentication is brute forced. Once authenticated the files are copied to the share.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WMI COM Interface\n",
    "For programatic access to WMI the wiper uses COM. The COM GUID `4590F812-1D3A-11D0-891F-00AA004B2E24` is used to accesss `IWbemClassObject`\n",
