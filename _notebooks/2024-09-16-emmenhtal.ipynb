    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Orange Cyberdefense](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/global/blog/cert-news/emmenhtal-a-little-known-loader-distributing-commodity-infostealers-worldwide) the delivery chain involves a .lnk file that is used to launch a plyglot EXE/HTA file with powershell and mshta. This is a similar technique to one used by Zloader in 2022 according to [CheckPoint](https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/can-you-trust-a-files-digital-signature-new-zloader-campaign-exploits-microsofts-signature-verification-putting-users-at-risk/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The polyglot is constructed by compbining a beign PE file (for example `notepad.exe`) with an HTA script. The HTA script is split into parts (header tag, script, end header tag) and the benign PE file is pasted between each part. The resulting file appears to be a PE file, and does contain multiple copies of the benign PE, however when executed with `mshta` only the script components are read by the HTA parser and the file becomes an HTA document. This launches a a chain of obfuscated script stages which eventually download and run the payload.\n",
