    "### Identify the MSVC version \n",
    "Appearently the STL type definitions change based on the version of MSVC that is used. To make sure are applying the correct types we need to first make sure we have the right version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "- We can use Detect it Easy [DiE](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) to figure out the version. \n",
    "- We might be able to improve on the DiE signature and make some standalone sigs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Working Approach\n",
    "Die (and many other PE analysis tools) simply read the PE rich header info and extract the version information form this. We can read the rich header info as good as anyone, let's just do this directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING** This approach relies on the rich header info of the PE both being intact and being correct (unmodified). If the header info is mangled or modified we cannot use this approach. In these cases it may be necissary to try something more dynamic? \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compiler/Liker References\n",
    "- Die info [Microsoft Visual Studio.4.sg](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy/blob/master/db/PE/Microsoft%20Visual%20Studio.4.sg)\n",
    "- A list of versions on github [dishather/richprint](https://github.com/dishather/richprint/blob/master/comp_id.txt)\n",
    "- The supposed best one is from [PEStudio](https://www.winitor.com/download)\n",
    "  - If we just want to references directly they are in the bundled `rich-header.xml` file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "From PEStudio: `Utc1900_CPP,Visual Studio 2015 - 14.0,24` - this is C++ 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the correct type structs into IDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating the type definitions into structs does not seem trivial! It's template madeness! We do have the type definitions for STL [Microsoft STL](https://github.com/microsoft/STL) but we need some way to parse them and we need some way to differentiate between versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Working Approach\n",
    "This is where the [`Holy  Bible of MSVC types`](https://github.com/RolfRolles/Miscellaneous/blob/master/MSVC-CRT.md) comes in. But we still have a parsing/translation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO - More Research Needed** We need a tool/process to \"compile\" the template defs into structs keeping intact all variations of the template. I'm not sure if this is possible, or if something like this exists currently? For now we are doing this manually, NOT IDEAL!\n",
    "- One idea might be to compile dummy files and import the pdb to get the type info?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "We have located the def for the string type for our compiler version [14.0,24 std::string](https://github.com/jackqk/MyStudy/blob/84313c1eaed7351d37b609288d1d32bf3b808859/DrvApp/StlInclude/xstring#L494). This def is the same as the one we have already defined in the fork of [HexRaysPyTools](https://github.com/oopsmishap/HexRaysPyTools/blob/784f8a7fba4b2db5fe9d4d2139f670faff252eb0/HexRaysPyTools/types/templated_types.toml#L18) but this was done manually (not ideal). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locate the type helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "- If we compile a \"dummy\" PE with a bunch of STL types, and no opimization we might be able to use BinDiff to ID some of the helper functions. At a minimum we can use the PDB to import the correct struct definitions. \n",
    "  - My assumption is that even though the target will be optimized (destorying many of the helper functions) we only need one good one to ID the argument types and we can propogate them backwards once we identify one! \n",
    "- We can use the existing FLIRT sigs (built into IDA) and maybe create our own (or steal some from github) but this is again at the mercy of compiler optimization. WE have noticed that when IDA identifies these functions the function prototype is incorrect because they do not have the correct STL type defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Working Approach\n",
    "##### Sig approach with FLIRT\n",
    "There is some limited success with this, the default IDA sigs do pick up some helper functions which can be used to ID and propogate the function types (this is a good start, and free work!). In addition to the built in IDA FLIRT we will also try these sigs from Mandiant [siglib](https://github.com/mandiant/siglib/tree/master/sigs). These sigs also seem to have some success in identifying some helper functions for the types which we can use to ID the type (argument) and then propogate that type to the other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Neither of these have a high success rate due to compiler optimization** (nor should any signature based method).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bindiff Approach\n",
    "This is a complete bust! Optimization causes too much change in the code for us to realistically be able to match much (some FPs etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO** This seems like an unsolved problem currently. The best we can do is some signature matching... maybe we could build a big enough signature db? We need to research other approaches that have/haven't been tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apply the types in IDA \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "- We can either apply these directly if our \"helper function\" identification process works or\n",
    "- We can try the shape identification from the forked HexRaysPyTools to automatically identify known types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Working Approach\n",
    "1. Use the helper functions that we have identified in the previous steps to locate variables (arguments) that we know the type of\n",
    "2. Apply the type to these variables\n",
    "3. \"Back-propogate\" the type information for each identified variable (this is somewhat automated by the fork of HexRaysPyTools).\n"
