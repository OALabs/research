    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to take a look at one of the original \"VM\" protections used in malware, VM Zeus. Zeus is one of the orignal \"botnets\" that put ecrime on the map. The sourcecode was sold (and eventually leaked) which lead to many different variants. One of the variants implemented a custom VM that was used to protect the configuration file... known as VM Zeus (KINS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the Zeus variants have been catalogued in the the [ZeusMuseum](https://zeusmuseum.com/) curated by [@tildedennis](https://twitter.com/tildedennis).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we are going to focus on the VM mechanics, how it works, and how to analyze it, as a way to understand VM protection fundamentals. There is a lot of prior research on this VM that we will reference below.\n",
