    "Malware operators are using a cloned game cheat website, SEO poisoning, and a bug in GitHub to trick would-be-game-hackers into running Lua malware. Our notes are divided into two sections, the first part is focuses on the GitHub bug the enables the malware delivery and the second part covers our attempt to analyze the Lua JIT malware.\n",

    "## Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "The game cheat that has been targeted is an open source aim bot called AIMMY which is maintained in the following GitHub repository [Babyhamsta/Aimmy](https://github.com/Babyhamsta/Aimmy) with the website [aimmy.dev](https://aimmy.dev/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The malware operators have made a clone of the GitHub repository here `https[:]//github[.]com/nehuenbohm/Aimmy` and setup a malicious website `https[:]//aimmy[.]app` which links to the cloned GitHub repository. The website also has a modified download link which **links to malware** hosted at `https[:]//github[.]com/Babyhamsta/Aimmy/files/14475029/Aimmy.zip`. Note that this download link is for a ZIP file that is **hosted on the original benign GitHub repository**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The malicious website has a high Google rank (likely due to SEO poisoning) and is ranked above the legitimate aim bot website. Users searching for the aim bot are likely to be tricked into visiting the malicious site and downloading the malware.  \n",

    "\n",
    "A key element in the attack involves hosting that malware payload on the original benign repository. This both distances the operators from the payload host and also may enable the download URL to blend in with normal traffic. Using this trick makes it difficult for the victim to identify that they are clicking a malicious link. But how are the operators able to host their malware on another GitHub repository? This had us stumped until [@JustasMasiulis](https://twitter.com/JustasMasiulis) discovered the bug â€¦ feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "When opening an issue on a repository **any file uploaded to the issue is stored under the GitHub repository where the issue when opened**. These files persist even if the issue is never saved. This means that anyone can upload a file to any git repository on GitHub an not leave any trace that the file exists except for the direct link. \n",

    "The malware operators also used a clever technique to obscure the fact that they have cloned the original GitHub repository. ArsTechnica recently detailed similar [malicious cloning attacks](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/02/github-besieged-by-millions-of-malicious-repositories-in-ongoing-attack/) but in this case we were able to observe the attack in real time, and can report some additional details.\n",

    "- The target repository is downloaded then uploaded to a new account, it is not forked.\n",
    "- Though the git commit history is maintained in the newly uploaded repository it does not display as a fork of the original repository.\n",
    "- The operator then makes **thousands of empty commits** to the repository, likely scripted, making it appear as though they are main contributor to the project. In the case of the aim bot the operator made over seven thousand commits in a 24h hour period. \n",
    "- The final commit is made to the project README changing the project download links to the malware URL. This commit is made as a GitHub verified user as the user is verified for the repo. "
