    "    - if it does then simply alter the address to point to the next-state entry_bb\n",
    "    - if it doesn't then find the next available code cave - if it doesn't immediatly follow the bb we are f-ed!!\n",
    "- if there is more than one next-state again check for a jmp as the final state instruction or a code cave following the bb\n",

    "We made a bad assumption when we derived conditional next states. Our assumption was that we could rely on the FLAGS that were used to set the state to still be intact by the time the state exited so all we would need to do is add a conditional jmp based on the FLAGS. This turned out to not be the case for all states so our conditional jumps were incorrectly influenced by other code in the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack #1\n",
    "One hack that we tried was to iterate through all insructions in the state and whenever the STATE register was invovled we replaced the instruction with an instruction to save the FLAGS in the STATE register. The assumption was that the last move into the STATE register would be the conditional one since it would overwrite the unconditional STATE. \n",
    "```\n",
    "9c -> push flags\n",
    "5b -> pop ebx (store FLAGS in state register)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then before we added our conditional jump we moved the flags back into the FLAGS register. The idea was that now our conditional jump would be based on the same FLAGS that were used to set the STATE earlier in the state basedic blocks. \n",
