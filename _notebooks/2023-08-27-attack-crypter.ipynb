    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The crypter uses a generated mutex to ensure only one version of the payload is installed, but this mutex is not random it is prepended with the string `attackercrypter` lol!\n",
    "\n",
    "The crypter also claims to have anti-vm checks which are optional... these are simply a *manufactor* check via WMI `Select * from Win32_ComputerSystem`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "if ((manufacturer == \"microsoft corporation\" && item[\"Model\"].ToString().ToUpperInvariant().Contains(\"VIRTUAL\"))\n",
    "                            || manufacturer.Contains(\"vmware\")\n",
    "                            || item[\"Model\"].ToString() == \"VirtualBox\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Payload Decryption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spoiler alert this is not really a cryptor lol!** Instead of protecting the payload the tool converts it into encrypted data that is stored as a string. This string must then be uploaded to a \"drop site\" but the operator and then the \"drop site\" URL placed in the tool to generate the \"stub\". This \"stub\" is not a stub it is actually just a downloader that will fetch the payload, decrypt it, and load it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the opposite of what you would like in a crypter as the loader will actually look the same for every \"build\". Let's check in on the VT detection rate in a week: [11c38fc24bf7b29cd6e974670bc11d7f92af124d8b7edcd89482500f4de3d442](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/11c38fc24bf7b29cd6e974670bc11d7f92af124d8b7edcd89482500f4de3d442).\n",

    "In this sample the drop site is `http[:]//paste.sensio[.]no/ReplicaSerena`\n",
