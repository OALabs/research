    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to learn a bit about how to use [angr](http://angr.io/) for control flow deobfuscation. We are using the Pandora Ransomware sample as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample (packed)** \n",
    "\n",
    "[`5b56c5d86347e164c6e571c86dbf5b1535eae6b979fede6ed66b01e79ea33b7b`](https://malshare.com/sample.php?action=detail&hash=5b56c5d86347e164c6e571c86dbf5b1535eae6b979fede6ed66b01e79ea33b7b)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Concept\n",
    "We have a binary that has been obfuscated using control flow flattening (CFF). The original control flow (CF) of each function has been replaced by a state machine. Each of the original code basic blocks (BB) has been given a state. To transition between the basic blocks a dispatcher is used which routes the control flow based on the current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Before CFF\n",
    "![](https://i.postimg.cc/hvPGV1mp/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-11-11-54-PM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### After CFF\n",
    "![](https://i.postimg.cc/MTwHpSpk/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-11-15-10-PM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing CFF\n",
    "The theory behind removing CFF is to identify the state of each original BB, and the \"next\" state(s) that each original BB along with the condition that sets each of these states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Block State**\n",
    "The BB state can be thought of as -- what state must be put INTO the dispatcher to route to the BB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next State**\n",
    "The \"next\" state depends on whether the BB has conditional control flow. If there is no condition then there will only be ONE next state. However, if there is conditional control flow there will be TWO next states with a dependency on some condition within the BB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice determining theses states and next states can be difficult as the dispatcher may be complex and the conditions used to set the next state may also be complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Analysis\n",
    "Before we can begin analyzing the CFF state machine we need to extract the following initial information from the function.\n",
    "- The function entrypoint (this is assumed)\n",
    "- The address of the DISPATCHER start\n",
    "  - It may be possible to determine this heuristically as many bb will jmp to this address\n",
    "- The STATE variable \n",
    "  - The STATE variable is the variable used to pass the STATE to the DISPATCHER. In simple CFF cases the same variable is used throughout the original code blocks but in more complex CFF this cannot be relied on.\n",
    "- The address of each of the original code basic blocks \n",
    "  - This may not be needed initially depending on the strategy. It maybe be possible to recover these during symbolic execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Emulation Approach (For Comparison)\n",
    "To associate a state with each original code block we can first collect a list of states using some simple assembly pattern matching in the original code blocks (the state will be moved to EAX). Then start emulation at the dispatcher start and run an emulation for each state stopping on the first jmp to an original code block -- this is the state for that block. Then once we have the states associate with each block we can manually connect up the original basic blocks and remove the dispatcher. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has many drawbacks, but the main issues are finding the states using pattern matching. Depending on how the states are set it may not be as simple as collecting all of the states by looking for a mov eax, immediate. Also, once the states are assigned to the basic blocks determining what conditions trigger which next state for each bb may also prove complex and very brittle (less re-usable code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Symbolic Execution Approach\n",
    "With symbolic execution we are not limited to the constraints of the variables, but can \"symbolically execute\" over all possible paths between the dispatcher and the original basic blocks. This allows us to test all possible options for the STATE variable. T\n",
    "\n",
    "### Associating A STATE With Each Original Basic Block\n",
    "The first step is to associate a STATE with a an original basic block (OBB). We have an advantage with the state machine in that we know the initial state (it muste either be set in the entrpoint or passed into the funcation as an argument). Once we know the initial state we can use this to execute until we reach an OBB. We can now associated this state with the OBB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining Next STATE(S)\n",
    "Once we have reached the start of an OBB we can symbolically execute until we reach the dispatcher again. Once we reach the dispatcher we can query the symbolic equation for possible value(s) of the STATE. There may be multiple values depending on the conditional logic in the OBB. These STATE values are the next states and will allow us to further interrogate the function to associated with with more OBBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CFF State Machine Parsing Algorithm\n",
    "The full algorithm for parsing the CFF state machine is described below. \n",
    "- Use initial STATE and execute from the start of the DISPATCHER until reaching an OBB\n",
    "- Assocated this STATE with the OBB\n",
    "- Continue executing until reaching the DISPATCHER\n",
    "- Solve the symbolic equation for the STATE(S) to determine the NEXT-STATE(s) of the OBB\n",
    "- Associate these NEXT-STATE(s) with the OBB (STATE -> OBB -> NEXT-STATE)\n",
    "- Repeate the process for each NEXT-STATE treatin each one as the new STATE \n",

    "## Complete Solution from @mrexodia\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach less initial information is needed about the binary. Also this approach will work on the un-patched binary (something I didn't realize was possible with angre). One of the advantage of Angr is that it is able to read and interact with the hard-coded jmp table without additional hooks/patches. \n",
