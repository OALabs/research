    "## Payload Obfuscation \n",
    "\n",
    "The ransomware has both obfuscated strings and control flow obfuscation. The obfuscated strings can be deobfuscated directly with an emulator call to the deobfuscation function. The cf obfuscation requires special attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach to Control Flow Obfuscation \n",
    "It appears as though some sort of control flow flattening has been applied to the main function. The basic blocks (bb) that contain the actual payload code are accessed via a state machine. The dispatcher uses a state as a key which is used to calculate jumps between basic blocks. The dispatcher code uses a compare with the key/state to generate a conditional lookup in a hard coded jump table. The jump table contains an obfuscated address of the next bb. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach is to seperate the dispatcher bb from the payload bb. For each dispatcher bb the code is emulated with all conditions to generate the conditional jump addresses. The bb is then replaced with a simple compare and conditional jmp. Emulation is done with [Dumpulator](https://github.com/mrexodia/dumpulator).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Once the dispatcher has been deobfuscated we should be able to see the control flow for the payload bb and futher simplify the dispatcher possibly removing it completely."
