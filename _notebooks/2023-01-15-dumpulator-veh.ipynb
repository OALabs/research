    "### Guloader VEH \n",
    "The sample we are analyzing uses a VEH trick to redirect program flow... basically they set their own VEH then use breakpoints `0xcc` in the code to trigger a small algorithm in the VEH. This aglorithm is used to caculate a new EIP based on the byte following the breakpoint.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obfuscated Strings\n",
    "In addition to the VEH program flow obfuscation the sample also uses a two-stage string encryption algorithm. First, a function is used to fill a buffer with the encrypted string data using some unfolded constants and a bit of arithmatic. Then the buffer is passed to a string decryption algorithm. The first buffer fill function is often obfuscated using the VEH program flow redirection.\n",
