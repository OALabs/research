    "\n",
    "The process of \"walking the PEB\" to access the modules loaded in a process as been a shellcode meme since the beginning of shellcode. It's everywhere, and we all mostly understand how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue comes when we try to represent this cleanly in IDA's pseudocode view... accessing a `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` via its `LIST_ENTRY` in the `_PEB_LDR_DATA` structure creates a very messy IDB. Instead of the `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` members we see unhelpful offsets relative to the Flink and Blink member of the `LIST_ENTRY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/Ta8hGnm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this happens is that the `InMemoryOrderModuleList` is defined as a `LIST_ENTRY` in the `_PEB_LDR_DATA`. The `LIST_ENTRY` struct simply describes a linked list as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "typedef struct _LIST_ENTRY {\n",
    "   struct _LIST_ENTRY *Flink;\n",
    "   struct _LIST_ENTRY *Blink;\n",
    "} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem comes from where that struct is actually located in the `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY`...\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "typedef struct _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY {\n",
    "    PVOID Reserved1[2];\n",
    "    LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderLinks; //<---- Offset into the struct!\n",
    "    PVOID Reserved2[2];\n",

    "    ULONG TimeDateStamp;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `LIST_ENTRY` is offset into the `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` it means that when we attempt to cast a pointer to a `LIST_ENTRY` as a `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` we are off by some amount (in this case 2 * PVOID = 8 bytes). The following diagram attempts to explain the issue.\n",

    "IDA has a simple concept (with some insane syntax) to deal with this issue called a [shifted pointer](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1695.shtml). When assigning a type to `LIST_ENTRY` the shifted pointer syntax can be used to tell IDA that it is actually a pointer inside a larger struct with an offset. \n",
