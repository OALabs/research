    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Truebot (aka Silence) is primarily a downloader associated with the threat actor group [TA505](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/ta505). Recently there was a CISA alert [Increased Truebot Activity Infects U.S. and Canada Based Networks](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-187a) which described ransomware/extortion activity associated with the use of Truebot.\n",

    "- The binary uses an Adobe PDF icon possibly to trick victims into clicking it. It also displays a fake error message. `\"There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired. Adobe Acrobat\"`\n",
    "- The binary is padded with a significant amount of junk code that is not relevant to its operation. \n",
    "- The main code has some checks for debugging tools and AV which if detected cause the malware to execute a deception process (calc.exe)\n",
    "- There are multiple anti-emulation techniques used including ...\n",
    "  - Reading from a fake named pipe\n",
    "  - Calling EraseTape\n",
    "  - Checking for a valid code page with GetACP\n",
    "  - Loading `user32`\n",
    "  - Trying to open a random invalid file\n",
    "- The C2 host and URL path are encrypted using base64, urldecode, and RC4 with a hard coded key\n",
    "  - `essadonio.com`\n",
    "  - `/538332[.]php`\n",
    "- A hard coded mutex `OrionStartWorld#666` is used to ensure only one copy of the malware is running \n",
    "- A GUID is generated for the victim and stored in a randomly named file with the extension `.JSONMSDN` in the `%APPDATA%` directory. This GUID is also used in the C2 communications.\n",
    "- A list of processes running on the host is collected and combined with the GUID. It is base64 encoded then sent to the C2 server in a POST request.\n",
    "- The C2 has the option of sending the following commands\n",
    "  - **LSEL** - delete yourself and exit\n",
    "  - **TFOUN** - array of commands\n",
    "    - **EFE** - download payload, decrypt with RC4 (hard coded key), and execute PE\n",
    "    - **S66** - download, decrypt with RC4 (hard coded key),and inject shellcode into `cmd.exe`\n",
