    "We are doing a breadth-first search through bb. This is specific to the binary we are analyzing, we just noticed that the `jz`/`jnz` is used for dispatcher control flow (it will differ for other binaries). For our search algorithm we will relie on this to mark a transition from the cf to an obb. \n",

    "- Mark each bb as you go\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because we are doing a BFS and the CFF forces a loop back to the dispatcher so we are garunteed to have already seen the dispatcher **in cf** bb before we reach the end of the first **in obb**.\n",

    "## Approach For Identifying Original Basic Blocks (OBB) Using Symbolic Execution\n",
    "The drawback of the assembly approach is that the analyst must first identify what condition causes a transition between the obb and cf blocks. This is a manual process. If we want to fully automate this in a generic way we need to use symbolic execution to identify which bb are cf and which are obb.\n",

Once we identify the state we can use the same algorithm above but instead of using a `jz`/`jnz` assembly compare to test for a transition between a cf and obb block we can check our symbolic exeuction predicate to see if the state is an equation or a constant (ie. does the state change in the bb or is it constant) if it is constant than we know the state was not modified so this is a cf block if the state can change then this is obb. \n",
