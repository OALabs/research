    "## Approach For Identifying Original Basic Blocks (OBB) Using Symbolic Execution\n",
    "The drawback of the assembly approach is that the analyst must first identify what condition causes a transition between the obb and cf blocks. This is a manual process. If we want to fully automate this in a generic way we need to use symbolic execution to identify which bb are cf and which are obb.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this approach the analyst must still identify how the **state** is tracked (register) but heuristics can also be used to do this automatically. Once we identify the state we can use the same algorithm above but instead of using a `jz`/`jnz` assembly compare to test for a transition between a cf and obb block we can check our symbolic exeuction predicate to see if the state is an equation or a constant (ie. does the state change in the bb or is it constant) if it is constant than we know the state was not modified so this is a cf block if the state can change then this is obb. We must also track if the state has changed and how it was changed to determine if the bb has transitioned from a cf to an obb.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary\n",
    "- cf - control flow\n",
    "- bb - basic block\n",
    "- obb - original basic block (these are from before the obfuscation)\n",
    "- cf bb - control flow basic block also known as part of the dispatcher or \"obfuscation code\"\n",
    "- symbolic execution - a process of transforming bb assembly code into mathematical/logical equations that can be solved  \n",
    "- concolic execution - a mix of symbolic and real (emulation) excution ie. we sub in some concrete values to constrain the exectuion path where they exist in the code\n",
    "- BFS - breadth first search\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm \n",
    "**assumption** we don't want to use concolic execution, we just want symbolic execution because we want to trace every branch and we don't want a concrete STATE value we want a symbol (I think???)\n",
    "\n",
    "- on the entry to each bb reset to the STATE to be a symbol (I think this will force symboic execution)\n",
    "- for each bb step we check the following\n",
    "  - is the predicate an equation or a constant (ie. does it depend on the STATE). If it depends on the STATE then it must be a CF bb. \n",
    "  - if it's a constant or the predicate an equation does NOT depend on the STATE then it must be the same type of bb as the previous one\n",
    "  - check the STATE symbol, if it has been assigned a constant or an equation then this is a obb (if it's not undefined)\n",
    " - maintain a rolling label (**cf**/**obb**) for the bb as you step, propogate the label to each sequential bb until one of the above conditions is met\n",
    " - for each branch (new angr state) push this onto a queue and use a bfs approach \n",
    " - stop execution when we reach a labeled bb"
